# Dynamic-Dashboard

Pivoted three long survey records into subcategories and represented them in various graphical formats such as Line graph, Pie Chart, and Bar Graph. Added the slicers effect to each chart type to make the dashboard user interactive. This feature allowed the user for advance comparison of surveyed data. In the end, I have analyzed the observable differences and commonalities between the surveyed data using the concept of statistics.
